To create an AngularJS workspace using the Angular CLI (`ng` command), you actually need to be aware that the Angular CLI is designed primarily for Angular (the newer version) rather than AngularJS. However, you can still use the Angular CLI to create an Angular workspace that can house Angular applications, and you can include AngularJS as a dependency if needed.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Create an Angular Workspace Using Angular CLI

1. **Install Angular CLI**: If you haven't already, install the Angular CLI globally.

   ```bash
   npm install -g @angular/cli
   ```

2. **Create a New Angular Workspace**: You can create a new workspace using the CLI. The `--create-application=false` flag prevents it from creating a default app.

   ```bash
   ng new my-workspace --create-application=false
   ```

3. **Navigate to Your Workspace**:

   ```bash
   cd my-workspace
   ```

4. **Create Angular Applications**: You can create multiple Angular applications within this workspace. For example, to create an Angular application named `app1`:

   ```bash
   ng generate application app1
   ```

   Repeat this for other applications as needed.

5. **Add AngularJS as a Dependency**: If you need to use AngularJS in your applications, you can install it as follows:

   ```bash
   npm install angular --save
   ```

6. **Modify Application Code**: For each application, you can add AngularJS as needed. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how you might set it up in `app1/src/main.ts`:

   ```javascript
   import { enableProdMode } from '@angular/core';
   import { platformBrowserDynamic } from '@angular/platform-browser-dynamic';
   import { AppModule } from './app/app.module';
   import * as angular from 'angular';

   if (environment.production) {
       enableProdMode();
   }

   platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule)
       .catch(err => console.error(err));

   // Sample AngularJS Code
   angular.module('myAngularJSApp', [])
   .controller('MainController', function($scope) {
       $scope.message = 'Hello from AngularJS!';
   });
   ```

   You would also need to create an `index.html` that includes AngularJS and your Angular code.

7. **Serve Your Applications**: Use the Angular CLI to serve your applications:

   ```bash
   ng serve app1
   ```

   Then navigate to `http://localhost:4200` to see your application.

### Notes

- **Mixing Angular and AngularJS**: While you can mix AngularJS with Angular, keep in mind that they are fundamentally different frameworks. It's often best to gradually migrate from AngularJS to Angular if possible.

- **Transitioning**: If you're starting a new project, consider using Angular (the newer version) directly, as AngularJS is no longer actively developed or maintained.

This setup provides a clean way to manage multiple applications and can serve as a good transition point if you're considering moving to Angular.
